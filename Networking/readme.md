## Overview

**Project Title**: Accessing Inventory by Networking

**Project Description**: A client machine will run a program that retrieves inventory data hosted on a server. 

**Project Goals**: Learn how to request information from a server on a client machine and have a program for the server to receive that request and send information back to the client.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Import packages
2. Create client side and server side python files
3. Write code to initialize sockets on both ends and write code on each end to establish a connection
4. Write client side program to send and recieve requests from the server
5. Write the server side program to recieve and handle requests

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the server.py file
2. Run the client.py file
3. Follow the prompts from the client program
4. Kill the terminals when you are finished

## Development Environment

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Fix issue with handling successive, identical requests
* [ ] Use SSL to encode the data
* [ ] Host the server program on a web server
