# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Talon Hintze

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?

    2

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |      X        |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    * Create a database with data in at least one table to be used by a program.
    * Must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (query) data.
    * Must write software that builds the SQL commands, submits them, and then receives the results then uses the query results in some way.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

    Youtube, ChatGPT, W3Schools, SQLite website

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

    I already have a solid understanding of how SQL querying works. I will prototype tables and relationships in mySQL Workbench. After which I will create a list of features for the program. Then, I will work on developing the database and software. 

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

    A database that holds material requirements for woodworking projects as well as materials that I already have on hand. The goal will be to query the database when I want to build a project, have it compare the requirements against my inventory and tell me what material I need to acquire.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

    I will work on this module at least 3 times a week. 1 of those times will be at a study location on campus. The other 2 will be in my room. I will primarily work on this project in the evenings. 

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

    On the technical front, I anticipate running into problems connecting between softwares. I would love to use an open source SQL database structure on a friend's home server. It may be difficult to configure that software. On the behavioral front, I presume to run into issue with setting apart clear, dedicated time to work on the module without getting distracted.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  5/16    |  8:30    |   IM   | Initialized firestore project/created table|     1:32    |

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|

|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|        |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |        |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |        |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |        |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|                   |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
